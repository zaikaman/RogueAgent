1. The "Glass Box" Upgrade (Visualization & UX)
Hackathon judges love seeing "how" it works, not just the result.

Chain-of-Thought UI: Don't just output the answer. Create a dedicated panel that streams the agent's internal monologue in real-time.
Visual: "Scanning Frax liquidity...", "Analyzing sentiment on X...", "Detecting anomaly...".
Tech: Stream intermediate steps from ADK-TS to the frontend before the final response.
"Rogue" Personality Mode: Add a toggle for "Safe Mode" vs. "Rogue Mode".
Safe: Professional financial advice.
Rogue: High-risk, high-reward degen strategies, slang-heavy responses, maybe it "refuses" to do boring tasks.
Aesthetic Overhaul: Lean into the "Rogue" theme. Glitch effects, CRT monitor scanlines, a terminal-style input, and a dark, cyberpunk color palette (Neon Green/Deep Purple).
2. The "Autonomous Operator" Upgrade (DeFi & Functionality)
Leverage the IQAI/ATP requirement to the max.

The Burner Wallet: Give the agent a real, funded (testnet) wallet.
Instead of telling you "You should buy KRWQ," it creates the transaction payload and presents a "Sign Now" button.
Pro Move: Let it execute small transactions autonomously if you give it an allowance.
Portfolio "Hitman": A feature where you paste a wallet address, and the Rogue Agent "roasts" the portfolio or identifies the "weakest link" asset to sell immediately.
3. The "All-Seeing Eye" Upgrade (OpenMind Integration)
Focus on the OM1 "Perception" track.

Live Web Perception: Give the agent the ability to "see" current events.
Feature: "Read the Docs." Paste a URL to a new DeFi protocol whitepaper. The agent uses OM1 to read it and summarizes the "Red Flags" or "Alpha".
Smart Contract Auditor: The agent reads a verified contract on Etherscan and highlights suspicious functions (like unlimited minting) in plain English.
4. The "Multi-Agent" Upgrade (Complexity)
Show off architectural sophistication.

Good Cop / Bad Cop: Spawn two agents in the chat.
Agent A (Risk Averse) analyzes the safety.
Agent B (Rogue/Degen) analyzes the potential 100x.
They debate each other in the chat, and you decide who to listen to.
My Recommendation: If you want to win Design + Tech, go for a mix of #1 (Glass

Box)** and #2 (Autonomous Operator).

Make it look like a sci-fi hacking tool.
Make it actually capable of staging blockchain transactions.
Does any of these directions spark an idea? Or do you want to mix and match?
